# Prerequisites

There are hardware, software and service prerequisites for participating in this CodeJam. The exercises will be developed using different SAP Integration Suite services and communicating with remote services that will be made available for the CodeJam. 

Alternatively, the remote services can be run locally and we can use [Cloud Connector](https://help.sap.com/docs/CP_CONNECTIVITY/cca91383641e40ffbe03bdc78f00f681/e6c7616abb5710148cfcf3e75d96d596.html?locale=en-US) to enable the communication between SAP BTP and the local service. The prerequisites to run it locally are included in [running-locally-prerequisites.md](running-locally-prerequisites.md) *Note: This is recommended if you are doing this exercise outside of a CodeJam event*. 

## Hardware

None.

## Software

* A web browser supported by the SAP Integration Suite[^1]: For the UIs of the service, the following browsers are supported on Microsoft Windows PCs and, where mentioned below, on macOS. Note that, however, certain limitations might apply for specific browsers:

    Cloud Integration has been tested using the following browsers:
    - Google Chrome (latest version)
    - Microsoft Edge (latest version)
    - Mozilla Firefox (latest version)
    - Windows Internet Explorer (as of version 10)
    
    <br>

    > The application can also be used with Safari browser and Internet Explorer 9. However, some features might not work as expected.
* [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/downloads/), to send requests to the integration flows that we deploy to SAP Cloud Integration. Follow the installation instructions included in this [tutorial: Install Postman REST Client](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/api-tools-postman-install.html).
  > Once installed you can import the collection and environments included in the `./connecting-services-integration-suite-codejam/assets/postman` folder.

### Activating SAP Integration Suite capabilities

Once subscribed to the SAP Integration Suite service, we will need to provision the following capabilities:
- Cloud Integration
- API Management
- Extend Non-SAP Connectivity

To provision the SAP Integration Suite capabilities, follow the instructions included in [step 3](https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/cp-starter-isuite-onboard-subscribe.html#d87e7e9f-7862-410d-ae85-ede409587a60) of the  _Set up the SAP Integration Suite trial_ tutorial.


### Create SAP Cloud Integration runtime client credentials

Once subscribed to the SAP Integration Suite, we will need to provision the create an instance of the Process Integration runtime. This service allow us to create client credentials which can be used to retrieve data from the SAP Cloud Integration APIs or calling an integration flow.

From command line:
```bash
# Login to Cloud Foundry
$ cf login --sso

# Create instance of service
$ cf create-service it-rt integration-flow pi-rt-iflow -c '{"roles": ["ESBMessaging.send"],"grant-types": ["client_credentials"],"redirect-uris": [] }'

# Create service key
$ cf create-service-key  pi-rt-iflow iflow-client

# Get the credentials
$ cf service-key pi-rt-iflow iflow-client
```

From the BTP Cockpit:
1. Create instance of service
   ![create-service-instance](assets/pi-rt-create-service-instance.png)

   Ensure the `ESBMessaging.send` role is selected and the grant-type is `Client Credentials`

   ![create-service-params](assets/pi-rt-create-service-instance-2.png)

   Finalise by clicking the create button

   ![create-service-finalise](assets/pi-rt-create-service-instance-3.png)

2. Create service key
   ![create-service-key](assets/pi-rt-create-service-key.png)

3. Copy credentials: click on the service key just created and a pop-up will appear with the service key details, e.g. clientid, clientsecret, url, tokenurl.
