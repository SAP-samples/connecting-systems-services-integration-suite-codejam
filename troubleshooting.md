# Troubleshooting

This page intends to capture any issues that you might face while going through the exercises that are part of the CodeJam. 

## Cloud Integration

- #### Why am I unable to edit the integration flow?
    This is because our integration flow is not in edit mode. To switch to edit mode, click the `Edit button` (*upper right corner*).

- #### An internal server error occurred: End of input at line 1 column 1 path $.
    No body was sent in the request. Remember that our integration flow expects a JSON payload. See [request payload sample](exercises/03-build-first-integration-flow/assets/request-payload-sample.json).

- #### There is no endpoint URL in the deployed content page.
    In case you don't see the HTTP endpoint URL immediately in the deployed content page, it takes a couple of seconds before it is reflected in the UI. Refresh the web page a couple of times and it will then be displayed
