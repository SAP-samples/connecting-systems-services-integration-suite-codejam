# Exercise 03 - Building our first integration flow

At the end of this exercise, you'll have successfully created a simple integration flow that communicates with the SAP S/4HANA Cloud mock server.

> **What is an integration flow [^1]?** 
> 
> An integration flow allows you to specify how SAP Cloud Integration is to process a message. The modeling environment, provided in SAP Cloud Integration, allows you to design the details of message processing (its senders and receivers as well as the individual processing steps) with a graphical user interface.

The diagram below captures, from a data flow point of view, what we are going to achieve as part of this exercise. We will expose an HTTP endpoint through which we will be able to send requests to the integration flow we develop. The integration flow will extract some data (the employee_id) from the payload received, which will then be used to retrieve the Business Partner information from the SAP S/4HANA Cloud mock server. 

![Data flow](assets/diagrams/first_data_flow.png)

The integration flow expects a sample request message like the one below and it should return a response message like the one underneath the request.

```json
// Sample request
{
    "employee_id": "181987918"
}

// Sample response

```


## Access your Cloud Integration workspace

You set up SAP Integration Suite and activated several capabilities as part of the prerequisites of this SAP CodeJam. We now need to access the Cloud Integration workspace to start building our first integration flow.

üëâ Go to the BTP Cockpit and open the SAP Integration Suite application from within Services > Instances and Subscriptions and then choose the *Design, Develop, and Operate Integration Scenarios* tile.

![Accessing SAP Cloud Integration](assets/accessing-cloud-integration.gif)

We are now in the landing page of SAP Cloud Integration. The page is divided in the following sections: Discover, Design, Monitor, and Settings. We will be interacting the most with Design and Monitor. Below a brief explanation on what you can find in each section.

![Cloud Integration landing page](assets/cloud_integration_landing_page.png)

- Discover: Here, you can find predefined integration content provided by SAP that you can use out of the box and adapt to your requirements.
- Design: This is where you design your integration content. It contains the graphical integration flow modeling environment. You find a list of integration packages defined for the tenant. When you select an integration package, you can find the integration flows (and other artifacts) defined for the package (on the Artifacts tab).
- Monitor: This is where you can monitor your integration flow. You also use this section to manage additional artifacts that you need to deploy on your tenant to complement your integration flows (for example, User Credential artifacts to configure connections using basic authentication).


## Design

Let's jump to the Design section to start developing our integration flow. Before designing our integration flow, we will need to create an integration package. Cloud Integration allows us to assemble integration contents, e.g. integration flows, message mappings, value mappings, scripts, APIs, into packages so that they can be used in our integration scenarios.

![Design section](assets/design-section.png)

üëâ Click the Create button and enter a name and short description for the integration package.

| Field               | Value                                                            |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| *Name*              | Connecting Systems CodeJam                                       |
| *Technical Name*    | ConnectingSystemsCodeJam                                         |
| *Short description* | The benefits platform will send us a request for an employee ID. |

![Create Integration Package](assets/create-integration-package.gif)

Once created, we can start adding artifacts to our package. 

üëâ Navigate to the `Artifacts` tab in your integration package, Add an Integration Flow, specify a Name and ID for the integration flow. Once created, click on the new integration flow.

| Field  | Value                       |
| ------ | --------------------------- |
| *Name* | Request Employee Dependants |
| *ID*   | RequestEmployeeDependants   |

> If the `Add button` is greyed out it means you are not in Edit mode. Click the `Edit button` in the upper right hand corner.

![Add artifact to package](assets/add-artifact.png)

When accessing the newly created integration flow you'll notice a couple of things:

![New integration flow](assets/new-integration-flow.png)
- There is no connection between the Sender participant and our integration process or the integration process and the Receiver participant.
- The palette is greyed out (*highlighted in orange*) and we are unable to modify the integration flow. This is because our integration flow is not in edit mode. To switch to edit mode, click the `Edit button` (*highlighted in green*).
- The configuration section, at the bottom of the modeling area, is collapsed. The contents of this section will change depending on the object selected in the modeling area. To expand it, click the `Restore button`.
  ![Expand configuration section](assets/expand-configuration-section.gif)


### Modeling 

We will expose the integration flow via an HTTP endpoint. To send requests to the integration flow we will also require a user with the ESBMessaging.send role. The user we will use should have been setup as part of the CodeJam prerequisites.

üëâ If not in editing mode, click the `Edit button` to enter edit mode in our integration flow and connect the sender participant to the start message event and select HTTPS as the adapter.

## Sending a request to our integration flow

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The [URL's hostname](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/hostname) where our integration flow is deployed (https://my-instance.it-cpi018-rt.cfapps.eu10-003.hana.ondemand.com/http/my-endpoint) is very similar to the URL's hostname we access the SAP Cloud Integration UI (https://my-instance.it-cpi018.cfapps.eu10-003.hana.ondemand.com/itspaces/). Make sure to use the correct hostname when invoking the integration flow, if not an HTML page will be returned as a response when trying to send a request to the integration flow. Can you spot the difference in the URL hostnames?

I'm getting an HTTP 403 error message when posting a message from Postman to SAP Cloud Integration. What can I do?
It's a 403, not a 401... meaning that you are authenticating well to the service but the user you are using for communication doesn't have the right roles assign to it. Make sure that the user, like to be your.email@company.com, has the 

## Summary

Now that you are familiar with the basic functionality of SAP API Business Hub and the Business Partner API, we are ready to start interacting with the services from which our integration will be extracting data.

If you finish earlier than your fellow participants, you might like to ponder these questions. There isn't always a single correct answer and there are no prizes - they're just to give you something else to think about.
