## Monitoring

//TODO: Justo donec enim diam vulputate ut pharetra. Pulvinar proin gravida hendrerit lectus a. Leo a diam sollicitudin tempor id eu. Enim eu turpis egestas pretium aenean pharetra magna. Et molestie ac feugiat sed lectus vestibulum mattis. A iaculis at erat pellentesque. 

## Sending a request to our integration flow

Justo donec enim diam vulputate ut pharetra. Pulvinar proin gravida hendrerit lectus a. Leo a diam sollicitudin tempor id eu. Enim eu turpis egestas pretium aenean pharetra magna. Et molestie ac feugiat sed lectus vestibulum mattis. A iaculis at erat pellentesque. 

> ⚠️ The [URL's hostname](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URL/hostname) where our integration flow is deployed (https://my-instance.it-cpi018-rt.cfapps.eu10-003.hana.ondemand.com/http/my-endpoint) is very similar to the URL's hostname through which we access the SAP Cloud Integration UI (https://my-instance.it-cpi018.cfapps.eu10-003.hana.ondemand.com/itspaces/). So make sure to use the correct hostname when invoking the integration flow; if not, an HTML page will be returned as a response when trying to send a request to the integration flow. ❓❓❓ Can you spot the difference in the URL hostnames?
