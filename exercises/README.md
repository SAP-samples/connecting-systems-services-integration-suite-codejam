During the CodeJam, you will complete each exercise one at a time. At the end of each exercise, questions are included to help you think about the content just covered and are to be discussed with the entire CodeJam class, led by the instructor, when everyone has finished that exercise.

If you finish an exercise early, please resist the temptation to continue with the next one. Instead, explore what you've just done and see if you can learn more about the subject covered. That way, we all stay on track together and can benefit from some reflection via the questions (and answers).

See below for an overview of the exercises part of this CodeJam.

> ⚡️ An export of the finalised integration package is included in the [../assets/cloud-integration](../assets/cloud-integration/Connecting%20Systems%20CodeJam.zip) folder. The integration package - [Connecting Systems CodeJam](../assets/cloud-integration/Connecting%20Systems%20CodeJam.zip) - contains multiple integration flows, as they were saved after finalising an exercise. If you run into any problems, you can import these to your tenant and compare your integration flows against it.
