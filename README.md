Welcome to the Connecting Systems and Services Using SAP Integration Suite CodeJam repository. In this SAP CodeJam, we will look at different services part of the SAP Integration Suite and how we can use them to connect our systems and services. By the end of the CodeJam, we will achieve an integration scenario like the one below in the diagram.

## Integration Scenario

Let's imagine we work for a company, ITeLO. ITeLO uses an external platform to manage its Employee Benefits, through which its employees can select their benefits, e.g. discount gym membership, private health insurance, and dental. In addition, ITeLO is interested in expanding its adoption of the benefits platform to allow employees to include their dependants, e.g. spouse, child or other family members, as beneficiaries of the different offerings available on the platform. 

Currently, the benefits platform only has basic employee information, e.g. employee ID, personal email address, full name, and additional data will need to be shared to include dependants as beneficiaries. These employee dependant data exist within ITeLO's systems, and the benefits platform will need to communicate with these systems to retrieve employee dependant data. The employee dependant data is distributed across different geographies, Americas and the European Union (EU). The Americas server stores data for employees in the American continent, whilst the EU instance stores data for employees in the EU. 

We are in charge of building the integration scenario to allow the benefits platform access to the employee dependants' data.
  
The benefits platform will not store employee dependant data and will send our integration service a message whenever it needs an employee dependants' data. We will need to validate the employee ID sent in the message against our global SAP S/4HANA Cloud system before retrieving the employee dependant data from the servers hosting the data. Also, our integration service will need to log the requests received.

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites to follow the exercises in this repository, including hardware and software, are detailed in the [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) file.

## Material organization

The material consists of a series of exercises. These exercises build on each other and should be completed in the given order. For example, we start by creating a simple integration flow, and we will extend it in the subsequent exercises.

The repository includes some [slides](slides.md), which will be used when running an SAP CodeJam event. The slides were built using [Marp](https://github.com/marp-team/marp/) and an HTML export is included [here](slides.html). You can also [preview the slides here](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/SAP-samples/connecting-systems-services-integration-suite-codejam/blob/main/slides.html).

## Exercises

During the CodeJam you will complete each exercise one at a time. At the end of each exercise, questions are included to help you think about the content just covered and are to be discussed with the entire CodeJam class, led by the instructor, when everyone has finished that exercise.

If you finish an exercise early, please resist the temptation to continue with the next one. Instead, explore what you've just done and see if you can learn more about the subject covered. That way, we all stay on track together and can benefit from some reflection via the questions (and answers).

See below for an overview of the exercises part of this CodeJam.
