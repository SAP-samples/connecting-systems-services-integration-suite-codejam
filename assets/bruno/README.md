# Bruno Collection and Environments

A collection and a few environments are included in this repository to facilitate interacting with the APIs exposed by the services that we will be using in our integration. The collection and environments for the SAP S/4HANA Cloud mock server and the Business Partner Dependants mock service are included here.

Follow the instructions in prerequisites to know [how to import the collection and environments](../../prerequisites.md#bruno) in Bruno.
